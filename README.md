# blog
Hi, i have build this Blog project using python language with the help of Django framework.
Here's how this project work :
1.) when a new user visits to this website, the will see a homepage with some blogs of others.
2.) If a user wants to read the full article then the user need to login.
3.) If user has an account then he/she can login else they have to sign-up.
4.) In this project the user can create a blog post, edit and update the blog post, and can delete the blog post. 
5.) In this the user and the audience can see when and what time was this blog post was created and can also see when was it updated.
